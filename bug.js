This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined. It's a common mistake, but it can be tricky to debug, especially in React Native applications. For example, consider a component that fetches data from an API and displays it. If the API call fails, or if the data is not yet available, then the component might try to access a property of null or undefined data. This will result in a TypeError: null is not an object (evaluating 'data.property') error.
